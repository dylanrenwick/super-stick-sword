# Super Stick Sword - Fabric Branch

## Why this branch?

After a long break from modding, it was Fabric's fresh approach to modding that sucked me back in, and frankly the best
way to support the future success of Fabric is by building mods with it.

## Will you still maintain the forge version?

Unfortunately, no. I don't have time to re-learn forge while also learning Fabric and then simultaneously maintain 2 mods.
